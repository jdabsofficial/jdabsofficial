🎹 As a music producer, I love crafting beats that tell stories and evoke emotions. 🎵 You can find my latest tracks and remixes on SoundCloud.

💻 When I'm not making music, I'm diving into the world of programming. I'm passionate about coding and always exploring new technologies and languages to expand my skills.

📚 Currently studying at the University of Cebu, where I'm honing my knowledge in both music production and computer science.
